### **Summary**

Tingvard judge the “CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM CONSTITUTION v2.3” update constitution governance action **constitutional**.

---

### **Rationale statement**

This governance action is properly framed as an *Update Constitution* action under Article VIII, § 1–2 and satisfies the procedural and formal criteria required for constitutional amendments. The proposal includes a verifiable URL and content hash, fulfilling Article III, § 5. The text of the proposed Constitution and supporting documentation were published immutably, ensuring compliance with the constitutional requirement for transparency and verifiability.

The amendment mechanism defined in Article VIII allows the Cardano community to periodically review, revise, and improve the Constitution. The v2.3 proposal adheres to this principle by providing a formal on-chain submission that enables Ada holders and their representatives to decide through the prescribed governance process.

The proposed Constitution does not alter the fundamental balance of governance authority or the system’s core tripartite model but focuses on clarifying language, removing non-binding provisions, and reinforcing procedural safeguards. These refinements remain within the permissible constitutional scope.

Accordingly, Tingvard finds that this proposal satisfies the constitutional and procedural requirements for a valid amendment under Article VIII and aligns with the principles of transparent, community-led governance outlined in Article II.

### **Precedent discussion**

This decision reaffirms Tingvard’s position that amendments submitted through the *Update Constitution* governance mechanism are constitutional when they comply with the procedural safeguards of Article III, § 5 and Article VIII, § 1–2. It establishes that streamlining or editorial amendments that maintain the integrity of the governance model and adhere to prescribed submission and transparency standards are within constitutional bounds.

---

### **Counterargument discussion**

Concerns have been raised regarding the process used to prepare and socialise this proposal. The draft Constitution was developed in a shared Google document curated primarily by one individual, with input gathered through DRep rationales, document comments, and public discussions on social media. While this process demonstrates some degree of community engagement, it lacks structured, inclusive deliberation mechanisms that would more fully realise the participatory intent of Article VIII, § 1, which encourages amendments to be debated in forums deemed appropriate by the Cardano community.

Tingvard recognises that these limitations affect perceptions of procedural legitimacy but do not constitute a constitutional breach. The Constitution specifies expectations for transparency and deliberation but does not make any particular form of community consultation mandatory. Therefore, while future amendment processes would benefit from broader, more structured participation, Tingvard finds the current process consistent with the letter of the Constitution.

### **Conclusion**

Tingvard finds this *Update Constitution* governance action **constitutional**. It conforms to Article III, § 5 and Article VIII, § 1–2 and aligns with the Tenets of transparent and decentralised governance. While the method of community consultation could be strengthened, the proposal meets all procedural and formal constitutional requirements for adoption.
